### Домашнее задание к занятию "7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"

#### 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3 (необязательно, но крайне желательно).

   * Создал бакет в Yandex.Cloud

---
### 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы. 

   * Выполнил `terraform init`: создан локальный файл со стейтами.  
   * Создал два воркспейса `stage` и `prod`:
   ```shell
   terraform workspace new stage
   terraform workspace new prod
   ```
   * Вывод команды `terraform workspace list`:

     ![proof01](https://github.com/crursus/devops-netology/blob/main/images/proof-07-terraform-03-basic-01.png)

   * В уже созданный `yandex_compute_instance` добавил зависимость типа инстанса от воркспейса, что бы в разных ворскспейсах 
использовались разные `instance_type`.
   * Добавил `count`. Для `stage` должен создаться один экземпляр `aws`, а для `prod` два. 
   * Создал рядом еще один `yandex_compute_instance`, но теперь определил их количество при помощи `for_each`, а не `count`.
   * Чтобы при изменении типа инстанса не возникло ситуации, когда не будет ни одного инстанса добавил параметр
жизненного цикла `create_before_destroy = true`.

   * Вывод команды `terraform plan` для воркспейса `prod`:
     
```shell
kaa@kaa-vm01:~/devops/tf$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
